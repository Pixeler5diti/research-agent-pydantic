One of the most impactful use cases of AI agents is 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. Imagine having a research assistant that not only understands your topic but actively helps you uncover, summarize, and structure insights from the vast web of knowledge.
Here’s the flow:
- 1️⃣ Get a research topic from the user.
- 2️⃣ Dynamically generate new search queries and perform web searches.
- 3️⃣ Extract and summarize relevant information from each result.
- 4️⃣ Structure the gathered knowledge and continuously update the agent's state.
- 5️⃣ Deliver a well-organized research report, complete with sources, back to the user.
To bring this vision to life, I used 𝗣𝘆𝗱𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗔𝗜'𝘀 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗳𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸. It provides a clean, efficient way to build agents capable of iterative workflows like this.
