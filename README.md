A research assistant which helps to summarize and strucutre insights.

Here’s the flow:
- 1️⃣ Get a research topic from the user.
- 2️⃣ Dynamically generate new search queries and perform web searches.
- 3️⃣ Extract and summarize relevant information from each result.
- 4️⃣ Structure the gathered knowledge and continuously update the agent's state.
- 5️⃣ Deliver a well-organized research report, complete with sources, back to the user.

To bring this vision to life, I used 𝗣𝘆𝗱𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗔𝗜'𝘀 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗳𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸. It provides a clean, efficient way to build agents capable of iterative workflows like this.
